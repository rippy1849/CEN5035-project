# Sprint 1 Report

## Team Sprint Goal
Deliver the first end-to-end version of a Listings feature by implementing:
- Frontend listing creation UI
- Frontend listings feed UI
- Backend API endpoints for creating and retrieving listings
- Database initialization and persistence

---

## User Stories

1. **As a user, I want to create a listing using a form** so that I can submit item details to the platform.
2. **As a user, I want to view a feed of listings ordered by newest** so that I can quickly see recent posts.
3. **As a frontend developer, I want a working API contract** so that UI actions can read and write listing data.
4. **As a backend developer, I want persistent SQLite storage initialized at startup** so that listing data is saved and retrievable.
