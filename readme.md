# GatorBazaar
CEN5035 : Software Engineering


**GatorBazaar** is a Gainesville-specific buying and selling platform built exclusively for students.

The goal of the platform is to provide a safe, simple, and campus-focused marketplace where students can buy and sell items such as textbooks, electronics, furniture, bicycles, and other daily-use goods. Unlike generic marketplaces, GatorBazaar is restricted to students, helping reduce scams and ensuring that transactions happen within the local student community.

The platform allows users to create accounts, list items for sale with images and descriptions, browse and search for nearby listings, and directly communicate with sellers. Since it is focused only on Gainesville students, the system encourages quick in-person exchanges and affordable pricing, especially for students moving in and out of campus housing.

GatorBazaar aims to make student-to-student commerce more reliable, convenient, and community-driven.
